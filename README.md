# iGEM KU Leuven – Dry Lab 2025

## 🌱 Project Scope
The Dry Lab aims to complement the Wet Lab by offering computational and bioinformatic support in genome analysis, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) modeling, and kill switch design. Our main focus this year is on *Phytophthora* species (spp.), their interaction with antifungal peptides, and engineering solutions for pathogen resistance in **cacao plants**.

## 🧠 Main Goals
- Create a clean, structured AMP database relevant to *Phytophthora* spp.
- Perform comparative genomics and annotation across *Phytophthora* spp.
- Simulate and model in silico kill switches (UV-based, engineered bacteria)
- Support wet lab findings with computational insights and predictions

## 🧬 Tools & Resources
- JupyterLab
- KU Leuven HPC (VSC)
- FungiDB, UniProt, BLAST, NCBI, Ensembl
- GitLab for version control
- OneDrive for backups
