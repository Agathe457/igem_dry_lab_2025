# iGEM KU Leuven â€“ Dry Lab 2025

## Our Project 
The Dry Lab aims to complement the Wet Lab by offering computational and bioinformatic support in antimicrobial peptide (AMP) research, _Phythophtora_ species research, logic gate and kill switch design. Our main focus this year is on *Phytophthora* species (spp.), their interaction with AMPs and engineering solutions for pathogen resistance in **cacao plants**.

## Goals
- Create a structured AMP database relevant to *Phytophthora* spp.
- Create a structured *Phytophthora* spp database.
- Build an agent-based model with NetLogo
